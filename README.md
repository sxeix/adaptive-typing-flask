# adaptive-typing-flask service
This is the flask backend service of the adaptive-typing application.

You can run standalone with run.sh or use the quickstart.sh script on the [adaptive-typing](https://github.com/sxeix/adaptive-typing) project (make sure both repos are cloned into same directory).

Here you can find the Markov model used in the application.

Please note you will have to install `pandas` and `numpy` with `pip install`. Even then, the libraries may be out of date with the current implementation as of now.

In the process of deprecating this entire service and migrating to a fully web based application.
